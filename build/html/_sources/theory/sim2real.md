# Sim-to-Real Gap

The Sim-to-Real gap refers to the difference between the performance of machine learning models in a simulated environment versus their performance in the real world. This gap can be a significant challenge when developing and deploying machine learning models for a variety of applications, including autonomous systems such as self-driving cars.

One of the main causes of the The Sim-to-Real gap is the fact that simulated environments often differ significantly from the real world in terms of their appearance, dynamics, and sensory data. This can lead to machine learning models that perform well in simulation but poorly in the real world, due to the inability to accurately generalize from the simulated environment to the real one.

Commonly, the The Sim-to-Real gap is addressed by a mix of the following:

- Realistic simulations: By using simulations that more accurately capture the appearance, dynamics, and sensory data of the real world, the models thus learn closer to reality and can thus perform better. The probabilistic distribution of the simulation matches more closely the one seen in the real world.

- Domain randomization: Domain randomization involves adding random variability to the simulated environment in order to better approximate the complexity and variability of the real world. This can help machine learning models to learn more robustly and generalize better to the real world.

- Transfer learning: Transfer learning involves training a machine learning model on a large, diverse dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, more specific dataset. This can help the model to handle a wide range of variations and scenarios.

Addressing the The Sim-to-Real gap is a critical challenge when developing and deploying machine learning models for applications such as autonomous systems, and requires a combination of careful simulation design and robust machine learning techniques.

## How we tackle it

Argus aims to reduce the The Sim-to-Real gap by maximizing the similarity from generated adverse weather conditions to real world conditions. This is accomplished by using highly-performant GAN models that maximize the nearness intrinsically. The best way of ensuring models are robust to be used in the real world is by ensuring they are both trained and validated in scenarios that are highly diverse and representative of the real world. 

Argus ensures your model generalizes well to the different real-world conditions, and generates necessary data to train when it doesn't. It also ensures that any model that is over-performing on simulation is detected, by comparing it to real-like data. This has the benefit of reducing the likelihood of delivering to production a promising model in simulation that translates badly to real-world scenarios.

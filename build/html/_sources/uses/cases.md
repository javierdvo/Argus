# Use Cases

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to enhance vehicle safety and convenience by providing various features such as automatic braking, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control. Due to the downstream impact of decision-making for safety systems, any ML model that uses camera-based inputs should be evaluated to ensure that they are accurate and reliable. Argus provides the safety and assurance to be highly certain these systems are safe to use in multiple environments and weather conditions.

Some example use cases are:

- Testing the robustness of an ADAS system: Argus can be used to test an ADAS system's performance under a range of different conditions, including different lighting conditions, weather conditions, and road surfaces. This can help to ensure that the system is reliable and effective in a variety of real-world scenarios.

- Dataset augmentation: Argus can be used to generate synthetic images that are highly real-like to improve the dataset bottleneck for multiple ML models used in ADAS systems.

- Verifying the accuracy of object detection: Argus can be used to ensure that an ADAS OD system is accurately detecting and identifying objects in the environment, such as pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs, even in adverse weather conditions.

- Evaluating the performance of lane detection: Argus can be used to assess the accuracy and reliability of a ML lane detection model, including its ability to identify lane markings and maintain a consistent position within the lane for scenarios where it is snowing or raining.

- Detecting and correcting errors: Argus can be used to identify and correct errors or biases in the ML model algorithms, helping to improve its accuracy and performance over time.

- Providing feedback for system development: Argus can provide valuable data and insights that can be used to improve the design and functionality of an ADAS system, enabling it to better meet the needs of users and enhance vehicle safety.

# Licensing and Legal

The legal and licensing topics are of crucial importance for the development of Argus and must be thoroughly analyzed. Legal implications can be found in the following topics:

- Proprietary dataset collection
- Client dataset usage
- Open Source dataset usage
- Open Source model usage
- Model evaluation

In terms of Open Source dataset, as previously mentioned the licensing of the dataset must be taken into account. Most OS datasets won't be able to be used within the Argus system as it is a for-profit endeavor. Open source evaluation models might be restricted to the same limitations.

Proprietary dataset collection must be taken within the limits of the legal framework of the country that is desired to be used by the fleet of vehicles. 

Client datasets when applicable must be used and integrated only when the legal framework allows it, as it must be very clear that the data can be handled by a third-party and is adequately licensed.

Particular care must be taken when evaluating systems that can have trouble with obtaining the representative data due to legal reasons (i.e. evaluating private garages), as there would be a need for the dataset to be representative to have a usefulness in its evaluation and the legal limitations might restrict obtaining enough data to be representative.

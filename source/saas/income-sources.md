# Income Sources

Argus is meant to be a for-profit endeavor, so it must be able to generate income to be sustainable. As a SaaS the primary source of income is recurrent due to monthly billing. This is sustainable long-term as it ensures that a continuous development can be run with a positive cash flow. This ensures that generative models are constantly being maintained and upgraded, ensuring clients always have the best-performing state-of-the-art models (and thus the product is always kept valuable). As the generative models are of use to multiple clients, a small team can efficiently deliver noteworthy improvements to a much higher developer codebase, freeing their  The main income sources are:

- Monthly team-wide subscriptions according to the project needs.
- Per-shot evaluation of models outside that go over the subscription budget.
- Customized solutions or hosting for clients that require more complex strategies.

The following are some financial advantages of using the Argus platform for development

## Developer costs

For clients, Argus makes economical sense by reducing the time spent by developers in developing and maintaining evaluation models and frees that time so that it can be spent developing the actual ADAS ML models. An In-house development of similar pipelines internally within each company would require developers to constantly develop new generative algorithms, collect datasets and evaluate them to obtain their best performing models, while also maintaining DevOps and MLOps operations (and incurring in their costs). Additionally, as multiple clients can benefit from the same model, this allows each client to have a proportionally reduced investment. By offloading the development and dataset collection cost to Argus, they can reap the rewards with minimal investment. Thus, this arrangement is beneficial for all parties and is economically sound. As Argus is fully focused in evaluation and generative models it achieves specialization efficiency, thus enabling it to efficiently develop evaluation pipelines and datasets.


## Dataset costs

Dataset collection for ADAS systems poses a significant challenge. A fleet must be assembled and tested by actual drivers, additionally some weather conditions need to be met for it to be tested under those circumstances (which can depend on pure luck). By allowing the creation of synthetically augmented data to expand your dataset from clear images, Argus empowers data collection efforts and reduces the cost and time necessary to obtain statistically significant datasets.

## Testing costs

Evaluating ML models in the real world is quite expensive especially at a large scale and when considering complex scenarios. Testing needs to be done with a fleet of actual drivers, and it can be necessary to test under particular adverse weather conditions. This testing can potentially occur with every new model release if the acquired data is insufficient to evaluate correctly the data with statistical certainty. Argus mitigates this by allowing synthetically-augmented testing at a scale, ensuring the dataset is as descriptive and representative as required, and potentially extending clear/overcast tests with other conditions. Testing is done with minimal effort and overhead, and validates the models directly. By providing insights and analytics of the results, Argus further reduces the development cycle turnaround time.

Additionally, rework due to testing failing on the real world due to the Sim-to-Real gap is thus expensive as it requires this setup to be performed again. This is increasingly more expensive if there is a need for a product recall caused by a lack of testing on adverse weather conditions (Tesla has already recalled vehicles). Argus helps detect models which might not work in the real world beforehand, preventing faulty models from getting delivered to the vehicle.

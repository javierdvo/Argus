# Internal-Facing

Argus fulfills the following objectives in its internal-facing functionality:

- Allows for the development and deployment of generative models at a scale.
- Simplifies and minimizes the MLOps efforts required to ship the aforementioned generative models to the clients.
- Allows client user feedback as well as automated detection to improve the performance of generative models by identifying those scenarios where the image isn't sufficiently real-like
- Visualizes the evaluation of the Generative ML models, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
- Visualizes the development and improvement of the generative ML models over time, showcasing to the users that their synthetic augmentation is always state-of-the-art.
- Get insights into the performance of the generative models in a broader set of datasets (further enabling the performance showcase)
- Enables extending the generative training dataset for further improvements(data flywheel) with care.

The overarching goal of Argus for the internal team is to enable frictionless delivery of the best-performing models to the clients and evaluate those same models to constantly improve them and maximize their performance.


## How we accomplish this

Each Argus team member has access to the internal view, where they can

- Add or edit Adverse Weather conditions from the catalogue.
- Add or edit Generative models per-condition or full-stack.
- Edit and upload internal Datasets (and their ground truth) for use in the generative model training, validation and testing.
- Edit and upload Sample Datasets (and their ground truth) for use in testing.
- Evaluate Generative models with internal Test Datasets and evaluate their results for internal comparisons with previous ones and performance showcases.
- Identify scenarios or conditions where the generative models are underperforming to enable focusing on those for further improvements.
- Extend the internal datasets when applicable.
